# The Deoployment Branch 

## where is the source code?
If you are looking for source code, please checkout the [master branch](https://github.com/Arsenic-ATG/Snake/tree/master) of the repositiory 

## Where am I ?
- This is the "web-build" branch of the project which just contain the build files of the project (compiled to webasm using [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/))
- This branch is used by GH-Pages to create live web-deployed version of the project
- Curently there is no way to automate the buildilng process (as GH-pages only support statis hosting) so the build is updated manually for the time being
